# IJ-List_LUTs
This ImageJ plugin then opens every LUT file in the selected directory and creates a new RGB stack (automatically saved as LUTs.tif in the "/plugins" folder) consisting of a LUT strip and (if selected) the name in each slice (the LUT name and the LUT values are also stored as metadata in each slice of the stack).
